Water distribution system consists of an infrastructure that collect, treat, store and distribute water between sources and households. 
It is a combination of water sources, intake structures and service reservoirs through which water is distributed to consumers by a web of pipeline. 
To make it understandable, each component of water channels will be explained. 
The water distribution process consists of a huge database where there is a need to store data of each component on a daily basis or twice in a day, depending on the usage of water by customers. 
In this project, a logical database is created and engineered to relational data base and cardinalities are drawn between all the tables. 
Data is then inserted into these tables after importing the DDL file from Oracle SQL modeler to Oracle SQL Developer. 
Testing is also done using few SQL query commands to retrieve the data.
